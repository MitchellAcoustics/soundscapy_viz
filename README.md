# soundscapy_viz

A very simple frontend GUI for the [soundscapy](https://soundscapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. soundscapy_viz is designed to load in soundscape survey data and produce customised visualisations. Powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

**Disclaimer:** Both soundscapy and soundscapy_viz are in heavy development and are in beta stages. Things may change, be buggy, or just plain break.
